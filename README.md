# Online Resume
## Description

In this project I created my interactive online resume using HTML, CSS and Object-Oriented JavaScript.  The resume data is stored in four JavaScript objects. All of the HTML code needed to build the resume is stored in **js/helper.js** variables. 

The resume has four distinct sections: work, education, projects and a header with my bio. It also has an interactive Google Map with pins of location where I lived and worked.
